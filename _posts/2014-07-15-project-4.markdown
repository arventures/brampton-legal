description: <p style="text-align &colon; justify;">When disputes arise that are not criminal in nature, those disputes are resolved in the civil justice system. This is referred to as civil litigation. Disputes can arise in many ways&colon; between employer and employee; between business partners; between someone injured in an accident and the person who caused the accident; between parties to a contract; and many other scenarios. Whenever a wrong has been done to someone that is not criminal, the person who was wronged can ask the court to give them a remedy. We have experience with all types of civil litigation claims and can help you resolve your disputes.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">If you think that you have been wronged, it is important to get legal advice quickly. There are time limitations on how long you can wait before bringing a claim against someone in a civil litigation matter. Generally, that time period is 2 years from the time that you knew, or ought to have known, that the wrong was done to you. At Deol & Nagpal Law Firm LLP, our lawyers can help you understand your rights, and the timelines that apply.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Wrongful Dismissal Claims</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">An employer can always fire its employees, but there are laws that the employer must abide by. An employee can either fire an employee with cause, or without cause. With cause means the employer is firing the employee because the employee was in breach of their employment agreement. Without cause means the firing is not because of a breach of the employment agreement, but in that case, the employer must give the employee reasonable notice that their employment is being terminated or must pay the employee in lieu of that notice.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Disputes often arise between an employer and employee when an employee is fired. When an employee is fired with cause, the employee may dispute that they were in breach of their employment agreement or may dispute that they were given any warning. When an employee is fired without cause, the employee may dispute the amount of notice that the employer has given.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">If your employment is being terminated, it is important that you get legal advice. Even if your employer is providing you with notice, you should obtain advice to be sure that you are receiving the right amount of notice, and that you are being paid everything that you are entitled to.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Contract Disputes</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">A contract is an agreement that is made between two or more parties. Disputes often arise regarding contracts. In some cases, the contract is breached by one party, meaning that they do not do what they agreed to do under the contract. In other cases, there is a disagreement about what the contract really meant. When the parties cannot resolve these disputes themselves, the courts can resolve the dispute for them.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Construction-Repair and Storage Liens</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Liens that can be attached to property for non-payment are strictly governed. The Construction Lien Act provides strict timelines for the registration and perfection of construction liens. Whether you are a property owner who has had a lien placed on your property or you are a contractor who needs to place a lien, it is important that you obtain legal advice from a lawyer who understands construction and other liens.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">In addition to construction liens, we can assist you with construction contracts and obtaining financing and security for construction projects.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Small Claims Court</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Disputes involving property or claims worth $25,000 or less can be brought in Small Claims Court. We can assist you with your small claims court proceeding, either by acting for you in the proceeding or providing you with legal advice to assist you in representing yourself.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">At Deol & Nagpal Law Firm LLP, our goal is to help you solve problems.
