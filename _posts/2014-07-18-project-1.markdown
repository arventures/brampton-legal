However, even if you decide to represent yourself, it is ideal to seek advice from a defense lawyer. We can provide you with limited assistance by explaining the process and helping you develop a strategy for resolving the charges.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">We offer one-time free half an hour consultation for criminal matters. Reach out to us for your Criminal Defence needs.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Right to Silence and Other Rights</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms everyone has a right to silence, as well as other rights that must be protected, even when you are being investigated or charged. It is important to speak with a lawyer so that you understand your rights. For example, your right to silence could be applicable when speaking to the police and the interview could involve self-incriminatory statements. In certain circumstances, such statements made to the police or any third parties can be used against you at the trial.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Innocent Until Proven Guilty</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms also provides for a presumption of innocence. This is a fundamental right that applies to every accused. The presumption of innocence provides that the accused is presumed to be innocent until, after a fair hearing, he or she is proven guilty by an impartial and independent tribunal. The allegations made at the time of arrest are mere allegations until proven.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">We believe in treating everyone equally and fairly. Criminal proceedings and the procedure that applies are complicated. You may not understand all the implications and technicalities of a criminal proceeding. Having a competent criminal defense lawyer to plead your case will help guide you through it.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Pleading Guilty</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Criminal proceedings can be stressful for you, your family and those close to you. It is important to understand all your options and the ramifications of choosing from those options. Pleading guilty can seem like a good way to quickly put the matter behind you, and in some cases, it is the right decision. But, you must consider all the consequences. If you plead guilty to the charges you are facing, it may lead to the finding of guilt or conviction and may leave you with a criminal record. This can have long-term consequences. For example, it may impact your ability to gain employment, to travel or to volunteer. It is important to discuss your options with your criminal defense lawyer before you choose to plead.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Just because it is easy and inexpensive, doesn’t mean it is always the ideal option.</p>
