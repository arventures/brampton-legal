description: <p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Family disputes are emotionally draining.

We don’t just offer a listening ear but provide you with experienced legal advice and services. We understand that each case is unique, and we strive to design ideal solutions based on the nature and circumstances of each case.</p><h3 style="text-decoration &colon; underline; text-align &colon; justify;" />Divorce</h3><h4 style="text-align &colon; justify;">You need to get a divorce, before remarrying</h4><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">To remarry, you need to get a divorce. It is important to speak with a lawyer to understand when you can obtain a divorce, and what you need to do to obtain a divorce. Find a competent lawyer to discuss your options before you proceed in any direction. There are certain bars to divorce and there is a statutory wait period before granting the divorce; you must be aware of all the legalities surrounding your divorce before proceeding any further.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">No matter how long you have been separated for, a divorce order must be granted by the competent court before you can remarry.</p><h3 style="text-decoration &colon; underline; text-align &colon; justify;" />Parenting Plans</h3><h4 style="text-align &colon; justify;">Care for an after Separation</h4><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">When parents separate, it is important that they have a proper parenting plan. This is important for both the parents and the children. Access and custody arrangements may vary from one family to another. The common types of custody are joint, sole or shared custody.</p><h3 style="text-decoration &colon; underline; text-align &colon; justify;">Child support</h4><h4 style="text-align &colon; justify;">It is a liability of the non-custodian parent</h4><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Child support is a liability of the parent who doesn’t have custody of the child subject to shared parenting agreement or any other applicable qualifications.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">The amount of child support that must be paid depends on the paying parent’s gross income. While there are some factors that will impact the amount of child support that is payable, the following link gives you an idea of how child support is calculated <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/child-enfant/look-rech.asp">http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/child-enfant/look-rech.asp</a></p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">The child support order is usually enforced by Family Responsibility office (‘FRO”)</p><h3 style="text-decoration &colon; underline; text-align &colon; justify;" />Resolving Family Law Issues</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">There are many different options for resolving family law disputes. We work with our clients to pursue the best course of action to resolve their issues, based on a consideration of the issues at stake, the positions of the parties and the costs associated with each process.</p><h4 style="text-align &colon; justify;">Mediation:</h4><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Mediation involves bringing in a neutral third-party to help the parties resolve the issues between them. A mediator is not a judge but is someone who can help the parties work through their issues and agree on a resolution. Before initiating the mediation process, both sides need to consent to mediation, as a solution. If both parties are willing to resolve their issues by mediation, this can be a less expensive and quicker process than resorting to the courts.</p><h4 style="text-align &colon; justify;">Collaborative Law:</h4><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Collaborative law involves the parties retaining competent legal representation to help them resolve their issues. Each party signs an agreement of participation. This method of resolution works when the parties can communicate with one another, and both wish to resolve their issues in an amicable manner. To reach an agreeable solution, both sides with their lawyer(s) may need to attend several meetings.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">It is usually a cost-effective and speedy process.</p><h4 style="text-align &colon; justify;">Arbitration:</h4><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Arbitration is like hiring a private judge. The arbitrator is usually a retired Judge or senior lawyer and is qualified to conduct the arbitration. The parties each hire legal representation and they share the cost of the arbitrator. An arbitration proceeds very much like a case in court, but it can usually be completed faster. Arbitration also offers the benefit of being confidential.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">If you desire early dates and a speedy process, arbitration may be the right approach, but it will cost you more.</p><h4 style="text-align &colon; justify;">Adversarial system</h4><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">This is the Court system. It is typically lengthier and more time-consuming than any of the other options. It is possible to proceed with the other options, e.g., mediation, arbitration, or collaborative law, even if you are also proceeding through the court system. For example, even though you are dealing with the issues in the court, you may try to resolve some or all the issues through mediation.</p>
