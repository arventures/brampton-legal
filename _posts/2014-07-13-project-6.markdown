description: <p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Canada opens its door for nationals from other countries and welcomes them to immigrate to Canada. However, it’s not as easy as booking a flight and crossing the border. There are laws and regulations that apply to immigrants and potential immigrants, and those laws must be complied with.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">We have different programs under which you can apply to come to Canada. There are five (5) main categories of programs&colon;</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Study in Canada</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Our institutions of learning have a high number of international students. You are likely to meet a considerable number of students from your country of origin in one of Canada’s institutions of learning. For international students, you can only study in a Designated Learning Institution (“DLI”).</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Whatever school you apply to, ensure that it falls under a DLI. A DLI is an institution that has the mandate to enroll international students. You will need to apply to the school and wait for the admission letter before applying for a Study Permit. This permit shows that you are in Canada for studies.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">The study permit usually lasts the whole duration of your program plus 90 days, but it can expire before your studies are complete. In such a situation, you will need to apply for renewal, if you want to retain your status in Canada.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Work in Canada</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">If you would like to work in Canada, you will need to apply for a work permit. It refers to those working on a temporary basis. There are three types of work permits&colon;</p><ul style="text-align &colon; justify;"><li style="text-align &colon; justify;">Employer Specific&colon; includes your employer’s name, location, and the period for working.</li><li style="text-align &colon; justify;">Open&colon; with this permit, you can work for any employer except for those who do not abide by the regulations of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, and International Mobility Program.</li><li style="text-align &colon; justify;">Post Graduate&colon; it allows graduates to gain experience especially as they seek to improve their chances of acquiring Permanent Residency status.</li></ul><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Just like the study permit, a work permit also has an expiration date. You can choose to change your status by applying for residency or extension of the permit. We offer assistance to those applying for Permanent Residency and Work Permits, in all categories.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Skilled Workers</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">This program is for those with a specific skill set who would like to immigrate to Canada. In this program, all applicants are placed in a pool, the Express Entry System, and selection is done based on ranking. The skills you offer and your ability to contribute to the economy are significant factors to consider.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Sponsorship</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">In some instances, you could be looking to sponsor a spouse or family member to join you in Canada. The government of Canada adopted this initiative to promote reunification of families. You can only be a sponsor if you are 18 years of age or older.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">Only Permanent Residents, Citizens, and Registered Indians can sponsor their family members to Canada. As a sponsor, you should be able and ready to provide financial assistance to the one you want to sponsor. One of our areas of specialization is assisting applicants in their Spousal sponsorship, and family class sponsorship applications.</p><h3 style="text-align &colon; justify;text-decoration &colon; underline;">Business Class Visa</h3><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">This program applies to investors, start-ups and the self-employed. The program targets individuals who would like to invest in Canada and create employment opportunities for Canadian citizens.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">We understand the pressure, excitement, and sometimes frustration that comes with the immigration process. We offer efficient services as we help you fast-track your application, from start to finish.</p><p style="text-align &colon; justify;">We also provide representation in IAD and Federal appeals. You should consider coming to us for your preparation of sponsorship declarations for your Super visas and visitor’s visa.</p>
